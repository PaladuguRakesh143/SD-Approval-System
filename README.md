# SD-Approval-System
This project implements a server-driven, configurable approval workflow system designed to support dynamic multi-step approvals with customizable rules. Built with scalability and flexibility in mind, the system allows approval processes to be defined, modified, and extended directly from the backendâ€”without changing frontend logic.
